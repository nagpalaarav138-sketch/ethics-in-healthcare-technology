# Algorithmic Bias in Healthcare

## Overview
Algorithmic bias occurs when a technological system produces systematically unfair outcomes for certain groups. In healthcare, biased algorithms can worsen existing health disparities by providing less accurate predictions for underrepresented populations.

## Ethical Benefits
When carefully designed and monitored, algorithms can standardize care and reduce human bias. They can help identify at-risk patients and allocate resources more efficiently.

## Ethical Risks
Many healthcare algorithms are trained on datasets that do not adequately represent diverse populations. As a result, these systems may perform poorly for certain ethnic, socioeconomic, or age groups. This can lead to unequal treatment outcomes.

## Real-World Implications
If biased systems are deployed at scale, they may institutionalize inequality under the appearance of objectivity. This is particularly concerning because algorithmic decisions are often perceived as neutral or scientific.

## Open Questions
- Who is responsible for detecting and correcting bias in algorithms?
- Should biased systems be withdrawn even if they perform well on average?
- How can fairness be measured in medical AI?
